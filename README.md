# Linked-Lists
Project on LinkedLists manipulation
This is a project that I worked on which demonstrates Linked Lists in Java. 
There is a Book class which defines a single book object.
There is a BookList class which defines a node and the different methods that are used on the Linked List.
The Support_class is a class which is used to streamline some of the Driver's tasks
WrongYearException is an Exception class which creates a txt file containing the wrongly formmatted CSV values.
The Books txt file is where the csv data points are located 
And finally the Driver is the Main class where different tasks can be executed with the interface.
